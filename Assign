This is an individual or group assignment.  Submit written or typed answers.
Answers should be your own work.


1. Insert the following elements, in the given order, into a hash table
   of size 17, that is initially empty.  Show the table after every 3 inserts:
   [4371, 1323, 6173, 4199, 4344, 9679, 8472, 5001, 2220]

   (a) Separate chaining
   (b) Linear probing with h(x) = x mod 17.
   (c) Double hashing with h1(x) = x mod 17, and h2(x) = x mod 7 + 1.
   (d) Cuckoo hashing into 2 tables of 11 elements each, with
       h1(x) = x mod 11, and h2(x) = y mod 11, where y is obtained
       by a left circular shift of x (in decimal).  For e.g., x=4371, y=3714.

2. Run buildheap on the following array:
   A[1..15] = [10, 12, 1, 14, 6, 5, 8, 15, 3, 9, 7, 4, 11, 13, 2].
   Show the heap (array) after every 3 calls to percolateDown.

3. Run Insert(16) and then Insert(0) on the resulting heap.  Show the
   heap after each Insert.  You need not show intermediate steps.

4. Run DeleteMin two times on the resulting heap, and show the heap
   after each DeleteMin.
